# Digital-Oscilloscope
Digital Oscilloscope written in verilog,
 sorry guys to put this in .rar file, but there is too much files in it, be aware this
 project needs TLC549 ADC, this is an external ADC with 30kHz sampling rate, check Pin Planner to know where to connect
 the clock pins to the ADC IC.
