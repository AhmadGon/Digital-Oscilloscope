# Digital-Oscilloscope (DE2-115)
Digital Oscilloscope written in verilog,
 sorry guys to put this in .rar file, but there is too much files in it, be aware this
 project needs TLC549 ADC, this is an external ADC with 30kHz sampling rate, check Pin Planner to know where to connect
 the clock pins to the ADC IC, colormap and index MATLAB scripts to extract colormap and pixel index of any image and 
 convert them to mif files to use as a ROM table
